In priority :
	still need to href some links if in fix or background
	add a summary at the beginning of the report which is the sum of non compliance of each scan, graph and all in a "global" section
	result section need to make a separation with the next scan 
	work on multiple scan, scan result folder, etc
	bug with fold/unfold, search how to resolve it
	make an .exe ?


Need to do some research (easy) :
	gce_target_https_proxy_ssl_policy -> https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https#console_1
	gce_target_ssl_proxy_ssl_policy -> https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https#console_1


Later, need some reasearch (hard) :
	gae_uses_iap
	gce_firewallrule_traffic -> use loadbalancer pas en frontal
	gce_router_nat_log
	cloudsql_networkacl
	cloudsql_ssl
