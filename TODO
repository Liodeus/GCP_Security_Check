In priority :
	
	add to readme images about the html format
	bug with fold/unfold, search how to resolve it
	make an .exe ?
	csv format of the results ?

Need to do some research (easy) :
	gce_target_https_proxy_ssl_policy -> https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https#console_1
	gce_target_ssl_proxy_ssl_policy -> https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https#console_1


Later, need some reasearch (hard) :
	gae_uses_iap
	gce_firewallrule_traffic -> use loadbalancer pas en frontal
	gce_router_nat_log
	cloudsql_networkacl
	cloudsql_ssl


git commit -m "if results folder doesn't exist create it, reate a function to crete all the folders"
