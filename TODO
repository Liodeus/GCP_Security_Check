In priority :
	Do a better function for the Non compliances summary and add a non compliance summary by category

Report :
	html/pdf ?

Need to do some research (easy) : 
	gce_instance_location -> Major
	gce_target_https_proxy_ssl_policy
	gce_target_ssl_proxy_ssl_policy
	Being able to change user ? -> gcloud config set account

Later, need some reasearch (hard) :
	gce_firewallrule_traffic -> use loadbalancer pas en frontal
	gce_router_nat_log
	There's a bug when functions finish at the same time, printing get fck, found how to resolve that - check if it's still here ?
	Try to catch error in threads
	For functions which launch the same commands do something to speed things up
