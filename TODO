In priority :
	rework markdown_to_report
	add a summary at the beginning of the report which is the sum of non compliance of each scan
	work on multiple scan, scan result folder, etc
	add a button to unfold/fold everything, one by results and one for all
	references : make a href of each links


Need to do some research (easy) :
	gce_target_https_proxy_ssl_policy -> https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https#console_1
	gce_target_ssl_proxy_ssl_policy -> https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https#console_1


Later, need some reasearch (hard) :
	gae_uses_iap
	gce_firewallrule_traffic -> use loadbalancer pas en frontal
	gce_router_nat_log
	cloudsql_networkacl
	cloudsql_ssl
