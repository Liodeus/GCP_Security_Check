add more security check


gcloud compute disks list -> if "europe-" not in location -> gce_disk_location -> Major
gcloud compute firewall-rules list --format=json -> if logConfig == false -> gce_firewallrule_log -> Medium

Need to do some research (easy) : 
	gce_instance_location -> Major

Later, need some reasearch (hard) :
	gce_firewallrule_traffic -> use loadbalancer pas en frontal
