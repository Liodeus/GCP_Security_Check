In priority :
	Do a better function for the Non compliances summary and add a non compliance summary by category


Report :
	html/pdf ?


Need to do some research (easy) :
	gce_target_https_proxy_ssl_policy -> https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https#console_1
	gce_target_ssl_proxy_ssl_policy -> https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https#console_1
	Being able to change user ? -> gcloud config set account


Later, need some reasearch (hard) :
	gae_uses_iap
	gce_firewallrule_traffic -> use loadbalancer pas en frontal
	gce_router_nat_log
	cloudsql_networkacl
	cloudsql_ssl
	There's a bug when functions finish at the same time, printing get fck, found how to resolve that - check if it's still here ?
	Try to catch error in threads
	For functions which launch the same commands do something to speed things up, launch the command stock the result in a dictionnary, if data in dictionnary use it else launch command then add it to the dictionnary
