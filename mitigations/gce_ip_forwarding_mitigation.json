	"description": "GCE Instances should not enable IP Forwarding.\n\nIP Forwarding is a network feature that permits VM intances to forward network traffic between network interfaces and/or networks. Unless specifically required by a use case, and fully backed-up by firewall and routing configuration no VM instance should enable it, as it can contribute to a successfull network attack.",
	"fix": "This setting cannot be changed after the instance creation, you must delete it and created a new instance.",
