This service account is the compute engine service account for the project, who by default has the Editor role on the project. This means that by default, every instance in the project runs with editor rights on the projects. Should an instance be compromized, malicious activity would have editor role : all data in the project could be accessible (data leak risk), new ressources could be created (financial risk) or illegal activity could be carried out (liability risk).",
